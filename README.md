# Principal-Component-Analysis-PCA
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a widely used technique for dimensionality reduction in machine learning and data analysis. It works by transforming a high-dimensional dataset into a lower-dimensional space, while retaining as much of the original variation in the data as possible.

PCA finds a set of new orthogonal axes, called principal components, that represent the directions in the data that have the largest variances. These principal components are ordered by their explained variance, so that the first principal component explains the most variation in the data, the second explains the second-most, and so on.

PCA can be used for a variety of purposes, such as visualizing high-dimensional data in lower dimensions, speeding up machine learning algorithms by reducing the number of features, and removing noise from data. However, it is important to note that PCA is not always the best choice for dimensionality reduction, and other methods, such as t-SNE or UMAP, may be more suitable for certain types of data.
